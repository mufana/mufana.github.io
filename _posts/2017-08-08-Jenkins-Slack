# Jenkins notifications to Slack

## Background

I've been using Slack for quite some time now. Mostly during Windows Server Updates. Whenever an update is installed on a server, a few PowerShell scripts are executed to check wether that particulair server is still running accordingly. These checks include:

* Server still online.
* Server still member of the correct Active Directory domain.
* Necessary ports open.
* All autostart services started.
* Firewall up & running.
* Eventlogs for specific events.

If each of these checks pass with an [OK], a notification is send to Slack. 

### Why Slack

* First it makes my life a little easier. A simple message in Slack is far better then me having to read a dozen logfiles or eMails.
* It keeps things transparent. Anyone who's a member of the Slack Channel can read the messages. 
* It's great for keeping track of the 'history'. Searching Slack is way better then searching logfiles or eMails.

### Another use case

The example above is one way to use Slack. But you can use Slack for many different purposes. I'm currently building scripts to automate my company's 'onboard/exit' process. My intitial plan was to schedule these scripts on a server with the standard Windows Task Scheduler.

But then there was Jenkins. And I pretty much decided to use Jenkins instead. And for good reason.

* Everybody _able to login to Jenkins_ can execute my scripts.
* Jenkins has Git integration and thus; Source Control.
* We can include Pester test and execute them from the same platform.

There was however, one tiny flaw in the plan. _**The outcome of a task?**_ There's no way to know unless you login to Jenkins and find out. Now, I don't want to login to 'something' and check every task. I'd like to be informed. _**But how?**_

The answer to that turned out to be a simple one. 

First; Jenkins can send eMail messages. Which is nice but still requires me to login to something. 

Second; there actually is a 'Slack Notification Plugin'. And since Slack is on my Phone, I will receive push notifications. What's left is to pick-up my phone, wave around with it to activate the screen and voila!

## Setting things up

Setting up the Jenkins -> Slack notifications is easy. You can be up and running in less then 15 minutes. 

### Slack

The first step in the setup process is to configure Slack. Therefore:

1. Login to Slack

2. Create a new Channel for Jenkins. In the image below I named my channel ```#jenkins```

    ![Channel](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s2.png)

3. Open the newly created channel.

4. Click the: ```channel configuration``` button_ and click: ```Add an app```

    ![Addapp](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s3.png)

5. In the search bar type: ```jenkins```

6. Select the ```Jenkins CI``` app and press enter.

    ![JenkinsApp](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s4.png)

7. Click the ```Install``` button.

    ![Install](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s5.png)

8. Select the ```#jenkins```  channel you've created in step 2 and click: ```Add Jenkins CI integration```

    ![Config](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s6.png)

9. Next you will see a __Setup Instructions__ screen how to setup Slack integration within Jenkins. Pay extra attention to _**step 3**_ in this instruction guide. It contains the *Team Domain* and *Integration Token*. You'll them later to configure Jenkins.

    ![Jenkinscode](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s7.png)

So far for the Slack configuration.

### Moving on to Jenkins

1. Login to Jenkins.

2. Go to ```Manage Jenkins```

    ![Manage](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s8.png) 

3. Click on ```Manage Plugins```

    ![Plugin](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s9.png)

4. Click on the ```Available Plugins``` tab and filter on: ```Slack```

    ![Available](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s10.png)

5. Click on ```Download now and install after restart``` to download the plugin.

6. Click the checkbox next to ```Restart Jenkins when installation is complete...```

    ![Download](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s11.png)

7. This will restart the Jenkins server. If Jenkins is set to auto refresh, it will automatically refresh the webpage. If not: ```Enable auto refresh``` or press ```F5```

    ![Disbale](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s12.png)

8. When Jenkins is started; go to ```Manage Jenkins -> Configure System```

    ![EnableSlack](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s13.png)

9. Browse to the ```Global Slack Notifier Settings``` section.

    ![Slacknotify](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s14.png)

10. Fill in the settings you've gathered from Step 9 from the __**Slack Set-up**__. 

    * Base URL (Only if you have a custom Slack URL like: _chat.mycompany.com_).

    * Team Subdomain (The URL to your Slack team).

    * Integration token (Used to send notifications to Slack)

    * Channel (The channel you created in _step 2_ of the Slack configuration above).

11. Click ```Test Connection``` to test if the configuration works as aspected.

    ![Test](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s15.png)

12. If you have the Slack Client installed on your Windows / Mac or Linux box and the: __**notification preferences**_ set to _display_ to the desktop client, you will receive a message similair to this:

    ![Message](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s16.png)

    Otherwise, login to Slack (either the Webversion/Mobile or Desktop) and you will see something like:

    ![Msgslack](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s17.png)

Wasn't that difficult! Both Jenkins and Slack are configured and it's time to have some fun!

### Now Cut Me Some Slack!

I've already created a task in Jenkins. _Create File_. This is an example from the blogpost of: 'Matthew Hodgkins'. Link [here](https://hodgkins.io/automating-with-jenkins-and-powershell-on-windows-part-1) I will use this example in the instruction below.

1. Login to the Jenkins server.

2. Click the task. (In my example ```Create File```)

    ![Task](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s18.png)

3. Click ```Configure```

    ![ConfigTask](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s28.png)

4. In the _Build_ section you'll find the PowerShell code used for this task.

    ![Code](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s19.png)

5. Go to the ```Add post-build action``` section.

    ![Postbuild](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s20.png)

6. Click the drop-down menu and select ```Slack Notifications```

    ![Dropdown](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s21.png)

7. Now, I only want to know if a Task is successfull. So I've set the checkbox next to ```Notify Success``` 

    ![Confignotify](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s22.png)

8. Click ```Save``` in orde to safe the configuration.

9. Go back to the Jenkins homepage.

10. Before I'm gonna run this task; let's first proof that the code is actually working from the PowerShell ISE.

    a. Open a new PowerShell ISE and copy-paste the code from below.

    ```powershell
    Function Create-File {

    Param (
        [String]$Filename,
        $Message
    )
        
    $ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"
    # Create Temp Directory
    if (-not(Test-Path -Path 'C:\temp\jenkins\'))
    {
        New-Item -Path 'C:\temp\jenkins\' -ItemType directory
        Sleep -seconds 10
    
    
    }
    
    # Using the environment variables exposed by the Jenkins job 
    Set-Content -Path "C:\temp\jenkins\$($Filename).txt" -Value $Message  
    }
    ```

    b. Run the function as following:

    ![ExecuteCode](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s23.png)

    c. The proof that the code works!

    ![Works](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s24.png)                

11. Back to Jenkins! Click the ```Schedule a build``` button.

    ![Schedbuild](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s29.png)

12. Fill in the parameters and click ```Build```

    ![Params](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s25.png)

13. As soon as the build starts you will see it on the left side of the screen.

    ![Buildstart](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s26.png)

14. When the build is finished, open the the Slack Client (Web,Phone or Desktop) and go to your _Jenkins_ channel. There you will see a message similair to this:

    ![Success](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s27.png)

15. To proof that the task worked as aspected:

    ![proof](https://codeinblue.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/s30.png)

That's pretty much there is to it when it comes to the instruction to setup Jenkins -> Slack integration.

## Wrapping up

There are many use cases where Slack might come in handy. For instance; Pester testing. Jenkins is a Continuous Integration / Testing and Deployment platform. When all your colleagues use Slack for day2day communication, the outcome of Jenkins tasks in that Slack might prove to be a worthy asset.
